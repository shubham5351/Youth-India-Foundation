              <h2>ABOUT <span class="text-warning">US</span> </h2>
                 <p>
                  Youth India foundation, YIF is a social entrepreneurship platform where the youth of the nation gather to become an organization where development,
                   funding and implementation solutions to social, cultural, or environmental issues is focused on. Social entrepreneurship typically
                    attempts to further broad social, cultural, and environmental goals often associated with the voluntary sector in areas such as
                     poverty alleviation, health care and community development. Social entrepreneurs can include a range of career types and
                      professional backgrounds, ranging from social work and community development to entrepreneurship and environmental science.
              </p>

                  Let's try drawing a close line between the two to clear some misconceptions of any layman.
                  A businessman would be willing to make use of unoriginal ideas and to make something hot and profitable out of it. 
                  On the other hand, entrepreneurship is a process of actions of an entrepreneur who is a person always in search of 
                  something new and exploits such ideas into gainful opportunities by accepting the risk and uncertainty with the enterprise.
          
              </p>
              <p>
                  Entrepreneurs see possibilities and solutions where the average person only sees annoyances and problems. 
                  The 7 characteristics of successful Entrepreneurs are: self motivation, understanding self-offers, taking risks, 
                  knowing how to network, basic money management skills and knowledge, flexibility and mainly passion for the business. 
                  Youth India Foundation aspires to give the best platform for budding entrepreneurs by giving them the right guidance, 
                  experience and exposure to present their startup ideas
              </p>
              <p>
                  Youth India Foundation is an organization dedicated to empowering social entrepreneurs, connecting them with mentors, 
                  strengthening their enterprise models, and preparing them for capital investments to help them develop their enterprises 
                  by improving the effectiveness of their business model, marketing, and strategy.

              <h2>OUR <span class="text-warning">VISION</h2></span>
             <p>
                  Youth India Foundation envisages a future for India in which youth work with all their potential to make their dreams come true. 
                  Every individual's effort helps bring forth a change. Every action of ours today, will tell a story tomorrow. Let's all work hard 
                  together to write a beautiful story for India's bright coming days.

              <h2>OUR <span class="text-warning">MISSION</h2></span>
              <p>
                    India, home to about one fifth of the youth population of the whole world, is the fastest growing economy today. 
                    A country where majority of the population is the youth, it is extremely crucial to have a quality educational standard 
                    and adequate employment. However, in the past few years it has been observed that not only the employment rate has not 
                    increased but in fact has dropped down lower. This is due to multiple reasons, one of the many being one out of every 3 
                    persons who has successfully passed his 10th grade has completed his education to the requisite level and might even hold 
                    a basic degree. In technical terms, there is now, inflation in the number of such young people who hold some degree and quite 
                    naturally it is difficult to determine their suitability for jobs when there are common standards for judgment and it's 
                    impossible to employ them all.<br>
                    Keeping this in mind, Youth India Foundation attempts to create India's first youth driven social entrepreneurship 
                    platform where we will be focusing on bridging science and innovation with social service and welfare.
                    <div class="container" style="align-content: center;"> 
                        It is our mission to provide permanent solutions to those in need and we will strive till the very end to help bring about 
                        a change.

                    True success is not acing all your exams, working at the top notch companies, earnings millions of money but becoming 
                    a humble human who uses his power to bring smiles on the faces of the needy and one who contributes towards the making 
                    of a better society. I have always been actively participating in various activities apart from academics that taught me 
                    a great deal of skills and values that helped me achieve what I've achieved today, founding Youth India Foundation. 
                    My journey started from my school, Sai International where I got many opportunities like being the Cultural Secretary 
                    (Secondary) in the student council, being a member of the international press MUN, successfully planning and directing 
                    out school's biggest science fair SAITED working as the Finance Director and organising multiple events with mass footfall 
                    like Sai Abhinandan, MUN, Sai confluence etc - All these made it possible for me to learn to manage such a huge national 
                    team and making YIF. I thank everyone, all my dear friends and family that helped me accomplish so much and I look forward 
                    to doing more with all their love and support.

                    service projects for quite a long time now. I had the opportunity to manage various events and arrange sponsorships for them 
                    all. Content writing, story writing, poetry - I write to express. Hope we can walk together many miles and achieve for the

                    Capturing precious moments from life - photography - is something that helps you to know who you are, connecting you to 
                    your past, telling some untold stories that remind you of the times and places you've been at. I've always felt that's my 
                    soulful duty. I co-found YIF from the Chennai team and we will make sure this initiative becomes our most treasured and 
                    memorable part of our stories. I am that typical tech geek who spends most of his time reading and discussing tech blogs. 
                    I play many sports but I'm mainly a football player and was a part of our school team. I love taking my deep interest towards 
                    photography to a professional platform and hence I was the Director of Photography at our school's most unique and biggest 
                    science and tech fair in all of India, SAITED. I believe YIF will have a very fruitful journey and I am excited to capture all 
                    the wonderful moments we'll have together.

                Versatility - the key competency of the future. Just as important it is to master something you have a talent for, 
                it is equally important to take up new hobbies and develop them. I have always been involved in multiple types of 
                activities and all this versatile experience help me adapt to the competitive edge of the world. I am the co-founder 
                of YIF from the Chennai team. From finance to logistics, from managing huge groups of people on a national level to 
                organising several events, I think I've done it all. I have always had a special spot for art in my life - playing the 
                guitar, dancing, painting - I hope I can go a long way doing things I love.
